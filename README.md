- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jeanomobono, I'm from Venezuela, living in Costa Rica since 2016. Working on IT since 99 as developer, DBA and IT Manager.

During my professional career I have successfully performed various roles:
- **Application developer** in Oracle APEX, creating solutions for various business requeriments.
- **Oracle Database Administrator (DBA)** in charge of ensuring the proper functioning of databases installed on Linux/UNIX servers
- **IT Manager**, being my most recent role, I have been in charge of managing various areas of the department: from application development to server administration, end user support, personnel management, etc.

During this time I have continued learning:
- I have increased my skills with **Python** for backend application development with FastAPI.
- I have also taken advantage of the possibilities that ORDS (**Oracle REST Data Services**) provides to execute operations on the database, implemented with Python scripts.
- I have created APIs that allow the interaction of Oracle APEX applications with external services such as Google Workspace or existing electronic invoicing implementations in Colombia, Costa Rica and Panama.
- In addition, I have implemented various solutions in **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)** such as the creation of servers, virtual networks, microservices, etc; to meet the requirements of the organization.
- Iâ€™ve been developing soft skills and getting to know all the use cases for digital transformation in the organization.
